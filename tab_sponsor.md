## Event Types

The chapter meetings are the heart of the chapter. We need good content to bring to our members. Also, we need a good space that is welcoming and quiet for those attending to hear. We are looking for sponsors to help provide space and equipment for talks and presentations.

## OWASP Houston Chapter Happy Hour Sponsorship

The chapter is looking for sponsors to help fund happy hours. This opportunity can benefit both the chapter and the sponsor.

## OWASP Houston Chapter Technical Trainings

This chapter is looking to start helping build talent in this geographical area. We need to obtain training space, help setting up equipment, and even getting instructors here in the future.

## OWASP Houston Chapter Presenter Sponsorships

The ability to help top tier presenters to get out to our chapter, we need some help. This level of sponsorship will do just that. We need help getting talented presenters to the area.
