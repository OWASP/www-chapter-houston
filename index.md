### OWASP Houston Chapter In-person Meetup at Main Event Katy ###

**When:** Monday, March 3, 2025 @ 6:30 PM to 8:00 PM<br>

<br>

This will be an informal meeting where people on the west side can get together for a little bit. No formal agenda but hopefully we can find volunteers who are willing to start leading events.

Main Event is family friendly, so you can combine the meeting with some family game time.

24401 Katy Freeway, Katy, TX 77494
