## Welcome

Welcome to the Houston chapter homepage.

<hr/>

## Study Group Restarting Wednesday July 9
### Power up with PowerShell ###
<br>
This weekly one hour study group series is designed to help you learn how to use Windows PowerShell 5.1 and cross-platform PowerShell 7.x.

The focus will be on real world scenarios and learning by doing. The first sessions will focus on Windows but later sessions will cover 7.x on both Windows and Linux.

Since 5.1 is the default on Windows servers, we will start there. The primary IDE will be VS Code as it is the officially supported current PowerShell editor. Since you can't normally install it on production servers, though, running and debugging scripts in PowerShell ISE will also be covered as it overcomes the "it works on my system" issue.

### When ###
Every Wednesday from July 9 until August 27
<br>
7:15 PM - 8:15 PM
