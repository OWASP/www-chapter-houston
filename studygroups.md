### Our Study Groups ###

<table>
  <tr><td width="80%">
    The <strong>OWASP Houston Study Group</strong> is intended to provide an organized gathering of like-minded IT professionals who want to learn more about application security.   This is done through mini-discussions, demos, presentations, and series of meetings to cover more involved topics (i.e. book topics).   Generally the topics will be participant-led, meaning that attendees will volunteer their time to present or lead a discussion, whether a one-time presentation of a topic they wish to review or need help with, or walk through topics of a particular chapter of a book being covered.  There will still be OWASP leadership involved with scheduling and such, but the idea is to get a better “hands-on” approach to create a more productive learning environment.  We learn more when we are involved.</td>

### Current Study Group Topic ###

We are covering API Security. It will last several months with end date TBD.

The first session was an introduction to <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/">API Security Top 10 2023</a>

The second session covered lab setup.

In session three, we started exploring crAPI using Firefox Web Developer Tools, ZAP, Postman, and curl.

In session four, we will continue working with crAPI.
